# TCT-CC-001-Starfield

This is my take on the first ever coding challenge on The Coding Train (Dan Shiffman's) YouTube channel. I've converted the sketch from 2D to fullscreen 3D and added some controls for changing speed (which then happens gradually) and adding/removing stars. This was a fun challenge to go back to!
